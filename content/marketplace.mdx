As the creator behind this dynamic platform, I embarked on a journey fueled by a passion for both web development and streamlining business processes. Leveraging the cutting-edge technologies of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Xendit](https://xendit.co) for payment gateway integration, [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) with [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for robust database management, and [PrismaORM](https://prisma.io) for seamless ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), I sculpted an online marketplace that transcends traditional boundaries.  
The genesis of this project stemmed from a dual purpose: to fulfill the requirements of my thesis project and to cater to the intricate needs of SMKS Korporasi Garut in enhancing their product distribution mechanism.

Next.js, known for its speed and scalability, served as the foundation of the platform, ensuring optimal performance and a smooth user experience. TailwindCSS, with its utility-first approach, facilitated rapid styling iterations, allowing for a visually appealing interface that remains consistent across devices.

But what truly sets this marketplace apart is its integration with Xendit, a robust payment gateway solution. Seamlessly woven into the fabric of the platform, Xendit empowers secure and convenient transactions, fostering trust and reliability among users.

Beneath the surface lies the backbone of the operation: PostgreSQL and PrismaORM. PostgreSQL, renowned for its reliability and extensibility, provides a robust database solution capable of handling the intricacies of product management and order processing. PrismaORM, with its intuitive API and auto-generated query builder, streamlines database interactions, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

Beyond the amalgamation of technologies lies the core ethos of the SMKS Korporasi Garut Marketplace: to facilitate the distribution of products with unparalleled efficiency. Whether it's locally crafted goods or artisanal creations, this platform serves as a conduit for artisans and consumers alike, fostering connections and driving economic growth.
