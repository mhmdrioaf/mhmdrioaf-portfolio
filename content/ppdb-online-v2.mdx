### Adapting Education to Technological Advancements

As technology advances rapidly, various educational processes must adapt to the use of information technology. One such process is student enrollment. Initially, the student admission process was conducted solely in-person (offline). However, this method has become less relevant as the main goal for educational institutions now is to simplify the enrollment process to achieve the desired number of applicants.

### SMKs Korporasi Garut

SMKs Korporasi Garut is an educational institution focusing on agribusiness, aiming to produce competent industrial talents in their respective fields. Currently, SMKs Korporasi Garut offers four areas of expertise:

- **Agribusiness for Food Crops and Horticulture (ATPH)**: This program focuses on preparing students to acquire agribusiness skills in food crops and horticulture, both conventionally and hydroponically, along with organic farming competencies.
- **Agribusiness for Agricultural Product Processing (APHP)**: This program is designed to train students to become skilled workers and entrepreneurs in agricultural product processing. Additionally, students are trained in quality control (QC) of processed food products.
- **Animal Agribusiness**: This program aims to develop students' skills in healthy livestock agribusiness and foster an independent mindset as a crucial asset for becoming modern livestock entrepreneurs.
- **Automotive Light Vehicle Engineering (TKRO)**: This program prepares students to develop skills in the field of TKRO and cultivates an independent mindset as a primary asset to become skilled professionals in their domain.

### Project Introduction

This project is an enhancement of the previous student admission website [PPDB-V1](https://mhmdrioaf.vercel.app/blog/ppdb-online/). The project significantly improves the website’s interface, usability, and responsiveness across various devices. Moreover, it employs **Nest.js** as the back-end to manage student registrations, website content, applicants, and more, resulting in better performance compared to the previous version.

### Simplifying Administrative Processes

The project aims to simplify the registration process, including filling out registration forms, submitting required documents, and more. The goal of enhancing the registration process is to make it easier for general users to register. User experience is crucial to achieving the desired number of applicants.

### Utilizing Vite.js with Nest.js

The core optimization of the previous website lies in the tech stack used. The previous website used Firebase as its back-end, which posed several issues related to system flexibility and limitations imposed by Firebase. This approach made production costs more efficient. Moreover, using Nest.js significantly improved the website’s performance since the back-end operates on the same private server, enhancing security.

For the frontend, TailwindCSS is used to enhance the website’s appearance. With TailwindCSS, the current website has a better branding design and a more modern UI compared to the previous version.

### Advantages of the New Student Admission Website V2

- **Better User Experience**: The project focuses on ease of use for both applicants and school administrators.
- **Efficiency**: Automating tasks like form submission and document verification speeds up the admission process, saving time for both applicants and administrators.
- **Transparency**: Real-time updates and notifications keep applicants informed about their application status, promoting transparency and accountability.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reducing reliance on manual processes and paperwork helps SMKs Korporasi Garut minimize administrative costs.

### Overcoming Challenges

The main challenge in this project was deploying the website to a hosting platform using an NGINX-based/cPanel environment. The process of deploying Nest.js to cPanel is quite different from deploying standard Node.js applications. Monitoring server resource usage took considerable development time, but it resulted in significantly faster back-end performance.

## Future Prospects

The journey towards digital transformation does not end here. SMKS Korporasi Garut remains committed to enhancing the online enrollment system further. Future plans include integrating additional features such as online payment options and virtual campus tours, enriching the overall experience for students and parents alike.
