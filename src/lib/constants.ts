    description: `Thesis research process at SMKs Korporasi Garut. The research resulted in a web-based product sales information system (e-commerce). SMKs Korporasi Garut is an educational institution focused on agribusiness education. The distribution process of products produced by students or production units at SMKs Korporasi Garut is still conducted conventionally (door-to-door). Therefore, I proposed a web-based product sales information system, utilizing Next.js and PostgreSQL as its database foundation. I have successfully implemented various features such as: same-day delivery system using corporate delivery units and implementing delivery tracking using Google Maps; integrating the delivery system with available courier companies in Indonesia; integrating a payment gateway; referral feature that can be used by students to earn commissions in marketing; detailed reporting features on product trends, sales, referrals, and more.`,
